# JP Stereo Tool

A native Bitwig device that fills a gap in Bitwig Studio's metering options.

Primarily functioning as a stereo balance and phase correlation meter, it helps maintain well-balanced mixes and identify mono compatibility issues.

Additionally, it offers a few controls for shaping the stereo image, enhancing its utility in everyday music production and sound design tasks.
